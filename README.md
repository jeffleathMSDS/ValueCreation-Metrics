# ValueCreation-Metrics

I frequently see businesses whose operational leadership focuses exclusively on the P&L, while ignoring the Balance Sheet (and obviously Cash Flow).
One of the techniques to counter this is to promote a ‘value creation’ type metric, which offsets an ‘operating profit’ metric with key capital/ working capital detriments.
There are multiple ways to do this and it’s usually driven by the level of balance sheet detail your ERP readily provides.  A lot of ERP’s aren’t configured to provide balance sheet detail below and ‘company’/’legal entity’ level.
In the example in this Repo shows, I used a ‘modified’ value creation metric to drive the same conversations… by offsetting project level ‘gross profit’ with ‘project receivables’ and a capital charge for allocated project assets.
Not exactly text book ‘value creation’ / ‘net value add’, but effective enough to drive the right conversations and behavior within the operational teams.
*A note on the data in this file.  I’ve changed the details contained within the workbook, so it is not accurate, or reflective of true operational results.
